Goal of this exercise: 
In this checkpoint, we will continue building on top of the previous checkpoints' deliverables. The objective of this checkpoint is to practice SQL DML queries to insert, update, and delete records in the database.

Employee_Project (Roles)
•	Employee_Num_E = 101, Project_Num_P = 201, Role = "Frontend Developer"
•	Employee_Num_E = 104, Project_Num_P = 201, Role = "Backend Developer"
•	Employee_Num_E = 102, Project_Num_P = 202, Role = "Trainer"
•	Employee_Num_E = 105, Project_Num_P = 202, Role = "Coordinator"

Instructions
1.	Insert Records:  Write the appropriate SQL queries to insert all the provided records into their respective tables.
2.	Update a Record: Update the Role of Employee_Num_E = 101 in the Employee_Project table to "Full Stack Developer".
3.	Delete a Record: Delete the employee with Num_E = 103 from the Employee table and remove their corresponding entries in the Employee_Project table
